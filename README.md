## Nick and Isabella's wedding site

  Don't judge me for the code in this repository. This is a quick and dirty website for our wedding. I know I should put a js library in there and implement some templating or make sure all my js is extracted, but this is only for me to maintain. 

I probably should have just used a template website like The Knot, but it goes against my inner dev to not roll my own and make it way jankier. Much like a Jedi making their own lightsaber.
